PngNote is a free, open-source, handwriting note-taking app based on [BOOX SDK](https://github.com/onyx-intl/OnyxAndroidDemo/blob/master/doc/Onyx-Pen-SDK.md).

Use BOOX SDK: Leverage raw-rendering feature, similar stylus lag to the pre-installed note app.
Open-source.
Simple, minimum features: Just pencil, erasure, undo, redo.
Open data format: Use serial number png files with plain directories. Easy to share data by any folder-sync app. No need to export!

# Supported device

Here are the supported devices I heard.
BOOX Note3
Nova2
Following devices are not working
Poke3
I think most of Onyx devices except for the Poke series are working.

Also, there is a version for non-BOOX, standard Android devices.
